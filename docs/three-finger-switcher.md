# Three Finger Switcher

Last updated: 2026-10-03

## Status

Three Finger Switcher is a working local background macOS app that reproduces
the useful BetterTouchTool app-switching gesture without depending on
BetterTouchTool for recognition or key emission. It now owns the MacBook
trackpad's three-finger tap and horizontal swipe arbitration, so Spokenly and
the switcher cannot independently claim the same contact stream. A right swipe
opens the app switcher, while a left swipe performs one context-aware line
clear. A four-finger trackpad tap sends Return on full release, confirmed
working by the user on 2026-10-03. It runs in the same login-started helper.

The source currently lives outside this dotfiles repository:

```text
/Users/vp/.codex/three-finger-switcher
```

The signed build bundle is generated at:

```text
/Users/vp/.codex/three-finger-switcher/build/Three Finger Switcher.app
```

The stable installed bundle that should actually be run is:

```text
/Applications/Three Finger Switcher.app
```

The installed app automatically creates the per-user LaunchAgent
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.ThreeFingerSwitcher.login.plist`. This is
what brings the gesture back after logout, restart, or a Software Update
reboot. Running only the temporary build bundle does not provide reliable
restart persistence.

The app has bundle identifier `com.local.ThreeFingerSwitcher`. It has no
networking, accounts, telemetry, or database. It stores its small set of menu
preferences in `UserDefaults`.

Physical verification passed on 2026-08-22 after installing the directional
build. The user confirmed that the three-finger tap, right-swipe app switcher,
two-finger scrubbing, and context-aware left-swipe line clear work correctly in
normal use. The former BetterTouchTool trackpad triggers are absent from the
live BTT data store, and Spokenly's competing `threeFingerLight` mode remains
removed. The stronger palm-rejection calibration added on 2026-08-29 remains
pending physical verification on the installed build.

## Magic Mouse support (2026-10-03)

The installed app also recognizes Magic Mouse gestures independently of the
trackpad. BTT is not required. On 2026-10-03 the user tried the installed
two-finger activation with one-finger browsing and confirmed it feels much
better. This is the accepted interaction. Automated checks cover handoff with
either finger, no selection jump, navigation in both directions, final-finger
release, cancellation, and replay of the captured mouse input.

- Tap **two fingers** to toggle Spokenly on release through
  `~/Applications/Spokenly Toggle.app`, the same helper as the trackpad and MX Master.
- Tap **three fingers** to press an unmodified Return key in the focused app.
  Adding the third finger to a stationary two-finger tap promotes it to Return
  without toggling Spokenly. Both taps require 20–600 ms of contact, no more
  than 2 mm movement per finger, and full release within 150 ms of the first
  release. Movement beyond that limit disqualifies the tap even if fingers
  return to their starting position. Physical clicks, fourth fingers, stale
  input and replacement contacts reject taps. Swipes never fire tap actions.
  Physical verification of these revised mappings is pending.
- Slide **two fingers left** to clear text once through the same `LineClearRouter`
  as the trackpad: Control-U in supported terminals, Command-Delete elsewhere,
  and no action in the same excluded apps. Both fingers must move left at least
  1 mm, averaging 3.5 mm, with horizontal movement exceeding vertical by 1.8.
  Lift both fingers before another clear. Left movement inside an open switcher
  continues to navigate, never clearing text. Automated checks pass; physical
  verification of mouse line clearing is pending.
- Slide **two fingers right** to open native Command-Tab and select the previous app.
- After opening, lift either finger and slide the remaining finger right or
  left to navigate. Keeping both fingers down also supports navigation.
- Lift the final finger to select, with a 65 ms release debounce. One finger
  can keep the session open; it no longer commits after 160 ms. Switching
  between one and two initiating fingers re-anchors without changing selection.
  A new, unrelated contact cancels the session.
- A third finger or a mouse click cancels selection. A cancelling click is
  consumed, including its matching button-up.
- A quick right flick opens and commits. Initial leftward gestures clear text;
  vertical gestures do not open the switcher or clear text. Swipes do not toggle Spokenly.
- Pauses in movement do not select an app. A stalled stream cancels after two
  seconds. Reconnection is checked every two seconds and on wake.

Mouse entry requires 3.5 mm average rightward travel, at least 1 mm from each
finger, and horizontal movement exceeding vertical movement by a factor of 1.8.
Navigation uses 3.0 mm per step after a 150 ms HUD delay. These defaults are
separate from the trackpad's saved 2.5 mm sensitivity. Optional preferences in
`com.local.ThreeFingerSwitcher` are `magicMouseEnabled` (default true),
`magicMouseEntryMM` (3.5), and `magicMouseStepMM` (3.0). Restart the app after
changing distance settings. Disabling mouse support is picked up by the poll.

A Core Graphics event filter suppresses horizontal scrolling during the
initial two-contact candidate, all scrolling and pointer movement during
selection, all scrolling during a recognized line-clear gesture, and scrolling
for a short tail after completion. Vertical scrolling
passes through before a horizontal swipe is recognized. Scroll events do not
provide a dependable public device ID, so suppression is session-scoped:
scrolling from another device during an active mouse selection is also blocked.
Mouse gestures remain disabled if the filter cannot be installed.

Native Mouse two-finger desktop switching must remain off. The saved BTT
Magic Mouse Application Switcher mapping is superseded; BTT was not running
at installation. If BTT is re-enabled, disable that mapping to avoid overlap.

`Sources/MouseBridge/` uses the proven C bridge to retain the device list and
select the mouse using its IORegistry multitouch ID and mouse preferences.
It never treats every external touch device as a mouse. The existing default
trackpad monitor remains separate. Both inputs share a keyboard synthesizer
with session ownership so one device cannot release the other's Command key.

The passive diagnostic and analyzer are in `diagnostics/magic-mouse/` in the
source project. Captures are local runtime files in
`~/Library/Logs/MagicMouseProbe/`, outside the dotfiles repository. Recorded
mouse data verified 96-byte contacts, roughly 15 ms frame spacing, and a
3.8-second uninterrupted two-finger right/pause/left sequence. There was a
104 ms reporting gap, so short gaps must never imply release. Regression
checks replay the normal-use and continuous-swipe captures without posting keys.

### Startup and everyday use

Mouse and trackpad support run in the same installed
`/Applications/Three Finger Switcher.app`. The existing per-user LaunchAgent
starts that app after login, including after a restart. No separate mouse
helper, BTT process, diagnostic, terminal session, or manual launch is required.
The app runs without a Dock or menu-bar icon. Mouse support defaults to enabled,
so an absent `magicMouseEnabled` preference is normal.

On 2026-10-03 the LaunchAgent file and its loaded launchd job were checked:
`RunAtLoad` is true, the job targets the installed application, and launchd
reported last exit status 0 for its `/usr/bin/open` launcher. The current app
was running. A fresh reboot was not performed as part of this verification.
The app polls for mouse reconnection and restarts its listeners on wake.

The LaunchAgent starts the app at login; it does not continuously supervise
crashes or restart an intentionally quit app. If gestures stop completely,
open `/Applications/Three Finger Switcher.app` again. Keep its Accessibility
permission enabled. A major macOS update may require compatibility maintenance
because raw touch access uses a private Apple framework.

## Trackpad four-finger Return tap (2026-10-03)

Three Finger Switcher now owns four-finger tap for Return, replacing the saved
BTT mapping. BTT is not required. Keep its saved four-finger Return trigger
inactive if BTT is restarted, to avoid duplicate key presses.

A stationary four-finger tap sends one unmodified Return to the focused app
only after all fingers lift. It needs 20–600 ms contact, at most 2 mm travel
per finger, and release within 150 ms of the first lift. A valid three-finger
tap can become this gesture when the fourth finger lands, without toggling
Spokenly. Movement, long holds, new contact IDs, a fifth finger, stale input,
and palm rejection disqualify it. Once disqualified, the remaining contact
sequence cannot become a three-finger gesture. A 300 ms quarantine after the
four-finger sequence also protects against release tails.

Adding the fourth finger during pending or active switching, or after line
clearing, cannot produce Return. Four-finger swipes continue to pass to macOS.
The existing palm indicators now cover four contacts too, with combined area
normalized to the three-contact baseline. Only three-contact samples train
that baseline. Automated checks cover valid taps, partial release, swipe
cancellation, palm protection and existing trackpad/mouse behavior. On
2026-10-03 the user tested the installed four-finger tap and confirmed it
works. This confirms the Return tap; broader palm-rejection calibration and
native four-finger swipe behavior were not separately verified in that test.

## Three-Finger Arbitration

One recognizer owns the complete three-finger contact:

- A valid tap lasts between 5 and 600 ms, every finger stays within 2.0 mm of
  its starting position, and Spokenly is toggled only after all three fingers
  release through `/Users/vp/Applications/Spokenly Toggle.app`.
- A horizontal movement that reaches the existing swipe threshold, normally
  3.5 mm at Normal sensitivity, permanently becomes a swipe. Swipe
  classification wins over tap classification once that threshold is crossed.
  The recognizer confirms the direction after 40 ms, then routes a right swipe
  to the app switcher and a left swipe to one line-clear action.
- A left swipe fires exactly once per gesture after the 3.5 mm threshold and
  40 ms confirmation. Continued movement cannot repeat it, and the action is
  re-armed only after all fingers lift.
- Contacts that move farther than the tap allowance but do not reach the swipe
  threshold are intentionally ignored. This gap prevents an accidental brush
  from toggling Spokenly.
- A fourth finger produces no Spokenly action and cancels any active switcher
  session. During a still-valid stationary three-finger tap, it promotes the
  gesture to the four-finger Return tap described below. Stale input cancels.
- Palm rejection examines the complete raw frame before gesture recognition.
  Invalid or exceptionally large contacts reject immediately. Other frames
  require two indicators from pressure, relative contact area, combined area,
  a bottom-edge contact, or slow contact arrival. A rejected frame is never
  converted into an apparent finger release.
- Initial swipe classification requires all three fingers to move in the same
  horizontal direction. Centroid motion by only one or two contacts is ignored.

All three behaviors are owned by the background switcher process.
The line-clear action uses the cached frontmost application bundle ID, so the
context check adds negligible latency to gesture handling.
The old unnamed Spokenly `threeFingerLight` mode was backed up before removal;
Spokenly's built-in three-finger recognizer is no longer competing with this
app. To roll back, quit or disable Three Finger Switcher and restore that
backed-up `modes.v2` entry through Spokenly's settings, then re-enable its
three-finger mode.

## Current Gesture

### Right swipe, app switching

The preferred right-swipe interaction is:

1. Begin a horizontal swipe with three fingers.
2. The native macOS Command-Tab switcher opens and selects the previously used
   app.
3. Lift one finger, keeping two fingers on the trackpad.
4. Move those two fingers horizontally to scrub through the app list.
5. Lift the remaining two fingers to activate the highlighted app.

The recognizer re-anchors when contact changes from three fingers to two. This
prevents the centroid shift caused by lifting one finger from producing a
false app-switch step.

### Left swipe, line clearing

A left swipe is confirmed after 3.5 mm of horizontal movement and the existing
40 ms entry confirmation delay. It emits one shortcut based on the cached
frontmost application:

| Frontmost application | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Ghostty (`com.mitchellh.ghostty`), Alacritty (`org.alacritty`), Terminal (`com.apple.Terminal`), cmux (`com.cmuxterm.app`), Warp (`dev.warp.Warp-Stable`), or iTerm2 (`com.googlecode.iterm2`) | `Ctrl+U` |
| Three Finger Switcher (`com.local.ThreeFingerSwitcher`), Finder (`com.apple.finder`), Mail (`com.apple.mail`), Messages (`com.apple.MobileSMS`), Notes (`com.apple.Notes`), Reminders (`com.apple.reminders`), Calendar (`com.apple.iCal`), or Photos (`com.apple.Photos`) | Suppressed |
| Any other, unknown, or missing bundle ID | `Cmd+Delete` |

The shortcut is posted once when the left swipe is recognized. It does not
open or alter the Command-Tab session, and it cannot repeat until the current
three-finger contact ends.

Other supported behavior:

- A quick three-finger flick still switches once and commits.
- Keeping all three fingers down still supports the original three-finger
  scrubbing behavior.
- A fourth finger cancels an active switcher with Escape and releases Command.
- A stalled touch stream is cancelled so Command cannot remain held.
- The engine probes whether the private multitouch device is still running and
  automatically re-registers it after a device stop, system wake, or screen
  wake. This prevents the menu-bar process from remaining alive with a dead
  trackpad callback.
- Two-finger scrubbing remains controlled by the persisted
  `twoFingerScrubbing` preference.

## Current Calibration

The menu sensitivity controls the base three-finger distance. Two-finger
scrubbing uses `1.35` times that distance so it moves through apps more slowly.

| Menu sensitivity | Three-finger distance | Two-finger distance |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| High | 2.5 mm | 3.375 mm |
| Normal | 3.5 mm | 4.725 mm |
| Low | 5.0 mm | 6.75 mm |

The saved trackpad setting is High (audited 2026-10-03), so the initial
gesture needs 2.5 mm and each two-finger step needs 3.375 mm. The old menu
references below describe earlier builds; the current app runs without a menu.

Other recognizer calibration values are in
`Sources/SwitcherCore/SwipeRecognizer.swift`:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `entryDominance` | 1.5 | Initial horizontal movement must be 1.5 times the vertical movement. |
| `stepDominance` | 1.0 | Horizontal movement must exceed vertical movement while scrubbing. |
| `entryConfirmationDelay` | 40 ms | Confirms the initial swipe direction before routing the action. |
| `hudRevealDelay` | 150 ms | Lets the macOS switcher HUD appear before repeated scrub steps. |
| `twoFingerStepDistanceMultiplier` | 1.35 | Slows two-finger navigation relative to the base sensitivity. |
| `fourFingerQuarantine` | 300 ms | Prevents the tail of a four-finger system gesture from becoming a new three-finger gesture. |
| `endDebounceFrames` | 2 frames | Tolerates a momentary contact dropout before committing. |
| `staleFrameGap` | 2 seconds | Cancels a gesture after the raw touch stream stalls. |

Palm calibration is in `Sources/SwitcherCore/PalmRejectionFilter.swift`:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `pressureFloor` | `0.60` | Marks elevated contact pressure as one indicator. |
| `relativeAreaMultiplier` | `2.0` | Marks one ellipse at least twice the frame median. |
| `hardZTotalLimit` | `1.5` | Rejects an exceptionally large contact immediately. |
| `combinedAreaMultiplier` | `2.2` | Compares total ellipse area with the adaptive normal baseline. |
| `bottomEdgeFraction` | `0.12` | Marks a contact in the bottom 12 percent. |
| `contactArrivalWindow` | `70 ms` | Marks three contacts arriving over a longer interval. |
| `requiredIndicatorCount` | `2` | Requires two ordinary palm indicators to agree. |
| `baselineSampleLimit` | `24` | Bounds the rolling normal-area calibration history. |
| `palmRejectionQuarantine` | `250 ms` | Blocks the remainder of a rejected contact sequence. |
| `swipeFingerDirectionMinimumMM` | `0.5 mm` | Requires each finger to agree with the initial swipe direction. |

The combined-area baseline learns from one clean, indicator-free frame per
contact sequence. It is runtime-only and resets when the gesture engine
restarts. These are source constants, not menu settings.

Keyboard event timing is in
`Sources/ThreeFingerSwitcher/EventSynthesizer.swift`:

- Command is held before Tab is emitted.
- There is a 12 ms delay after Command-down so WindowServer recognizes the
  held-Command session.
- Cancellation waits 30 ms after Escape before releasing Command.
- Command-up is posted three times with 8 ms gaps to reduce the chance of a
  stuck modifier during UI animation.
- Left-swipe line-clear events use a single chord, either `Ctrl+U` or
  `Cmd+Delete`, selected from the cached frontmost bundle ID.
- A separate watchdog checks every 250 ms and cancels after a 2 second frame
  stall.

## Architecture

```text
MultitouchSupport.framework
  -> DeviceMonitor receives raw contact frames
  -> SwitcherEngine applies whole-frame PalmRejectionFilter
  -> SwipeRecognizer emits begin, step, commit, clear, or cancel
  -> FrontmostApplicationCache supplies the current bundle ID for left swipes
  -> AppSwitchKeyPlanner manages the held-Command lifecycle
  -> EventSynthesizer posts Command-Tab or line-clear events through Core Graphics
```

The implementation uses Apple's private `MultitouchSupport.framework` because
public macOS APIs do not expose the required system-wide raw trackpad contacts.
This means the app is not sandboxed, is unsuitable for Mac App Store
distribution, and may need maintenance after major macOS updates.

The raw device bridge deliberately uses `MTDeviceCreateDefault()` and treats
the device as an opaque pointer. Retaining it as an Objective-C object, or
borrowing a handle from a temporary device list, caused crashes during the
macOS 27 investigation.

## Background Operation

The app runs without a menu-bar or Dock icon. Its persisted gesture settings
continue to apply, and the per-user LaunchAgent starts it after login.

The relevant `UserDefaults` keys are:

| Key | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` |
| `stepDistanceMM` | `3.5` |
| `twoFingerScrubbing` | `true` |
| `onboardingShown` | Set after the first setup window |
| `launchAtLoginOptOut` | `false` |

## Build, Test, and Run

From the project root:

```sh
cd /Users/vp/.codex/three-finger-switcher
swift run SwitcherCoreChecks
./scripts/setup-signing.sh
./scripts/install-app.sh release
open "/Applications/Three Finger Switcher.app"
```

`setup-signing.sh` creates a ten-year local self-signed identity named
`Three Finger Switcher Dev` in the login Keychain. The release build uses this
stable identity so Accessibility permission survives rebuilds. If the identity
does not exist, `build-app.sh` falls back to ad-hoc signing, which can cause
macOS to treat a rebuilt app as a different Accessibility client.

`install-app.sh` builds and verifies the app, stages it in
`/Applications`, preserves the previous installed bundle as a local
backup, and replaces the stable installed copy. After an update, quit any old
running copy and open the installed app again.

First-run system setup:

1. Enable the app in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
2. Set System Settings > Trackpad > More Gestures > Swipe between full-screen
   applications to four fingers. This avoids a collision with the custom
   three-finger gesture.

The old equivalent BetterTouchTool three-finger app-switcher triggers must stay
disabled while this app is running. Otherwise BTT can race the recognizer for
the same trackpad contacts. This project does not automatically delete or
modify any unrelated BetterTouchTool trigger.

## Rollback and Recovery

To reject only the experimental two-finger interaction, turn off **Two-Finger
Scrubbing After Opening** in the menu. The original working three-finger path
remains intact.

To disable the entire custom gesture, stop the background app. BetterTouchTool
can then own the gesture again if its
corresponding triggers are enabled. The old BTT left-swipe trigger always sends
`Cmd+Delete`; enable it only if that static rollback behavior is wanted. To
restore Spokenly's original ownership of the three-finger tap, restore the
backed-up unnamed `threeFingerLight` mode in Spokenly after disabling this app.

To remove only custom palm rejection, delete its filter integration and restore
the previous `zTotal > 2.0` contact guard before rebuilding. For an immediate
rollback of all custom gestures, quit or disable Three Finger Switcher before
restoring one alternate BTT or Spokenly owner. macOS palm rejection is separate
and must not be changed.

The 2026-08-29 palm calibration remains pending physical verification. Test a
deliberate tap, right swipe, two-finger scrub, and left swipe, then reproduce
the accidental palm contact and confirm that it produces no action.

If the switcher ever appears stuck, lift all fingers. The recognizer commits on
release, and the independent watchdog cancels a stalled session after 2
seconds. Quitting the background app also sends a cancellation and releases
Command.

If a rebuild stops sending Command-Tab:

1. Confirm that the bundle is signed by `Three Finger Switcher Dev` with
   `codesign -dv --verbose=4 "/Applications/Three Finger Switcher.app"`.
2. Confirm Accessibility permission for the exact installed app bundle.
3. Quit and reopen the app after changing permission.
4. Run `swift run SwitcherCoreChecks` to separate recognizer problems from
   permission or event-posting problems.

## Origin and Future Work

The project began as a local replacement for the BetterTouchTool three-finger
Application Switcher behavior after reviewing the
[Can I Vibe Code It article](https://canivibecodeit.com/bettertouchtool). The
raw touch bridge and held-Command interaction were informed by the
MIT-licensed [Trident project](https://github.com/cyanyux/trident), with local
gesture recognition, menu controls, safety handling, tests, signing, and the
three-to-two-finger interaction built around it.

Possible future improvements:

- Give two-finger scrubbing its own menu sensitivity instead of a fixed
  multiplier.
- Publish the full source project to a dedicated repository on the user's own GitHub account later.
- Add structured runtime diagnostics to the menu.
- Recheck the private touch structure and callbacks after major macOS updates.
