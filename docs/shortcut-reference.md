# Custom Shortcut Reference

Last audited against live settings: 2026-09-03

## Purpose

This is the quick reference for custom inputs managed through Logitech
Options+, BetterTouchTool, and Spokenly. It records what a physical input does
now. Use the detailed setup guides for implementation history, database fields,
backup procedures, and troubleshooting:

- [Logitech Options+ and Spokenly setup](logitech-options-spokenly.md)
- [MX Master 3S reconstruction manifest](logitech-mx-master-3s-shortcuts.json)
- [BetterTouchTool gesture setup](btt/README.md)
- [Spokenly transcription profile](transcription/spokenly/README.md)
- [Three Finger Switcher](three-finger-switcher.md)
- [Ducky One 2 macOS setup](ducky-one-2-setup.md)

Live application settings are authoritative when this file and a detailed guide
disagree.

## Logitech MX Master 3S

### Shared gesture button

The gesture/top button (`c196`) uses Logitech's Application Navigation card in
all current profiles.

## BetterTouchTool

### Global keyboard sequences

| Physical input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Triple F4, no more than 0.35 seconds between events | Lock the screen using BTT's native Lock Screen action |

### Native MacBook keyboard listener

| Physical input | App scope | Owner | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standalone Globe/Fn tap, no more than 0.35 seconds | Ghostty or Alacritty | `macbook-fn-herdr-listener` LaunchAgent | Sends `Ctrl+B`, the Herdr prefix |

The listener reads explicit down/up values from the built-in keyboard's raw
IOHID Fn element, then uses a listen-only event tap to detect other keys,
modifiers, and media-key activity. It leaves all physical input unchanged and
sends the prefix only when Ghostty or Alacritty is frontmost at press and
release and no other input participates. The former BTT trigger
`3D18BB81-90D9-4CD9-BED3-9B46FBB2F683` is disabled and preserved solely for
rollback.

The working deployment requires the compiled binary at
`~/Library/Caches/dotfiles/macbook-fn-herdr-listener` to be enabled in both
Input Monitoring and Device Control and Data Access. The quick-tap path was
physically verified in Ghostty on 2026-08-15 and in Alacritty on 2026-08-16.
The live Alacritty test produced exactly one `Ctrl+B`, with the listener log
showing `allowedTerminal=true` and one `Fn tap triggered Ctrl+B` entry.

### Global MacBook trackpad gestures

| Physical input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 3-finger tap | Three Finger Switcher waits for release, then opens `Spokenly Toggle.app` |
| 3-finger swipe right | Three Finger Switcher opens the macOS app switcher and supports two-finger scrubbing |
| 3-finger swipe left | After 3.5 mm and 40 ms confirmation, sends one context-aware line-clear shortcut |
| 4-finger tap | Three Finger Switcher sends Return on full release |

Three Finger Switcher owns three-finger tap and horizontal swipe
classification, plus the four-finger Return tap. The latter requires 20–600 ms
of stationary contact, at most 2 mm travel per finger, and full release within
150 ms of the first lift. Added during switching, the fourth finger only
cancels. The saved BTT four-finger Return mapping is superseded and must stay
inactive to avoid duplicate Enter presses. The user confirmed the installed
four-finger Return tap works on 2026-10-03.

The three-finger Spokenly tap must last 5 to 600 ms with no more than 2.0 mm of
per-finger travel. Once the existing swipe threshold is crossed, swipe wins and
Spokenly is not toggled. A left swipe uses the cached frontmost application:
`Ctrl+U` in Ghostty, Alacritty, Terminal, cmux, Warp, and iTerm2, no shortcut
in Three Finger Switcher, Finder, Mail, Messages, Notes, Reminders, Calendar,
or Photos, and `Cmd+Delete` in every other, unknown, or missing-bundle app.
The left action fires once per gesture and is re-armed after all fingers lift.
The cache lookup adds negligible latency. All three-finger behaviors are owned
by the background Three Finger Switcher process.

Physical verification passed on 2026-08-22. The user confirmed that tap,
right-swipe app switching with two-finger scrubbing, and context-aware
left-swipe clearing work correctly in normal use. The superseded BTT trackpad
triggers are absent from the live BTT data store.

The stronger 2026-08-29 palm filter rejects a complete frame when two ordinary
signals agree, using pressure, contact ellipse area, adaptive combined area,
bottom-edge contact position, and contact-arrival timing. Invalid data and the hard
contact limit reject immediately. It affects only Three Finger Switcher and is
pending physical verification; exact values and rollback are in the
[Three Finger Switcher guide](three-finger-switcher.md).

### Global Magic Mouse gestures

| Physical input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1-finger tap | Left click at the pointer |
| 1-finger tap right | Right click at the pointer |
| 2-finger swipe left | Three Finger Switcher clears text once using the trackpad’s app-aware route: Control-U in supported terminals, Command-Delete elsewhere, same app exclusions |
| 2-finger swipe right | Three Finger Switcher opens native Command-Tab; lift one finger and slide the remaining finger left/right to browse, lift the final finger to select |
| 2-finger tap | Three Finger Switcher toggles Spokenly on release through `Spokenly Toggle.app` |
| 3-finger tap | Three Finger Switcher presses Return on release in the focused app |

The Magic Mouse two-finger switcher is owned by Three Finger Switcher as of
2026-10-03. It requires no BTT. The user confirmed the installed two-finger
activation and one-finger browsing interaction feels better. It starts with
the trackpad helper through the existing login LaunchAgent. The other BTT-owned mouse
gestures require BTT to be running. See [the switcher guide](three-finger-switcher.md)
for calibration and scrolling behavior. The custom two-finger Spokenly tap
and three-finger Return tap were mapped on 2026-10-03 and await physical verification. Saved BTT three-finger
middle-click and Codex Return mappings are superseded and must stay inactive
while the custom tap is enabled.

### Application-specific BTT shortcuts

Application-specific triggers override matching global gestures.

| Application | Input | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Trackpad 2-finger swipe right | Open the Codex chat switcher, then select the hovered chat when the final finger lifts |
| Codex | Magic Mouse 3-finger tap | Return instead of the global middle click |
| Codex | `Ctrl+B` | Toggle the sidebar between `By project` and `In one list` through the debounced helper |
| Codex | Normal-mouse horizontal scroll right | Toggle the sidebar between `By project` and `In one list` through the direct helper |
| YouTube Brave app | `Cmd+Shift+C` | Open the application menu and run its native Copy URL command |

### Spokenly keyboard shortcut

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| MacBook physical Right Option | Right Option bridge toggles the MX Master `test` mode |
| Ducky physical right GUI, immediately right of right Alt | Emits Right Option, then the bridge toggles the MX Master `test` mode |

The MX Master auxiliary/thumb button uses Logitech's `Spokenly Hands-Free`
Smart Action to open `Spokenly Toggle.app`, which calls `spokenly://toggle`.
The `com.vp.spokenly-right-option-listener` LaunchAgent routes the physical
Right Option event through `spokenly://toggle?mode_id=5D8361AD-F3FF-4A73-8D00-30D46B336947`,
the mode-specific deeplink for the MX Master `test` mode. Spokenly's native
Right Option trigger is disabled (`rawFlags: 0`) so the two paths cannot
double-toggle.
The MacBook trackpad three-finger tap also reaches Spokenly through that helper,
but only after Three Finger Switcher classifies and releases a valid tap. The
unnamed Spokenly `threeFingerLight` mode was backed up and deleted so it cannot
race the switcher. Magic Mouse two-finger tap also reaches the same helper through Three Finger
Switcher; its three-finger tap presses Return.

The complete machine-readable profile inventory, including Logitech card
payloads and thumb-wheel directions, is in the [MX Master 3S reconstruction
manifest](logitech-mx-master-3s-shortcuts.json).

## Spokenly

Spokenly `2.27.16` (`538`) uses the Right Option bridge with toggle activation.
The live preference leaves the native trigger disabled (`rawFlags: 0`), while
the listener opens the `test` mode's toggle deeplink after a bare Right Option
tap.

| Input | Result | Origin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MacBook physical Right Option | Toggles the MX Master `test` mode recording | Right Option bridge |
| Ducky physical right GUI, immediately right of right Alt | Emits Right Option and toggles the MX Master `test` mode recording | Native Ducky mapping, then the bridge |
| MX Master auxiliary/thumb button | Opens the helper and toggles Spokenly | Logitech Smart Action |

See the [Spokenly input profile](transcription/spokenly/README.md) for live
settings, device compatibility, automation hooks, and verification.

## Ducky modifier mapping

The Ducky One 2 Command, Option, and Caps mappings are owned by native macOS in
`com.apple.keyboard.modifiermapping.1241-661-0`. Physical right Alt remains
Right Command, while physical right GUI emits Right Option.

## Herdr

The live sources are `mac/.config/herdr/config.toml` and
`mac/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`. Herdr's prefix remains `Ctrl+B`, and
the prefix alternatives remain available. Alacritty forwards the Command
chords with `ReceiveChar`; the agent shortcuts depend on Option-as-Alt.

| Shortcut | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+B`, then `n` / `p` | Next / previous Herdr tab |
| `Ctrl+PageDown` / `Ctrl+PageUp` | Next / previous Herdr workspace (translated by Alacritty to Herdr prefix + `Shift+N` / `Shift+P`) |
| `Cmd+1` through `Cmd+9` | Switch directly to Herdr tabs 1 through 9 |
| `Ctrl+Option+1` through `Ctrl+Option+9` | Focus agents 1 through 9 |
| `Option+Tab` / `Option+Shift+Tab` | Next / previous Herdr agent |
| `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Next / previous Herdr tab; MX Master thumb wheel down/right and up/left in Alacritty, MX Master Forward is now `Ctrl+PageDown` for next workspace |
| `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+9` | Switch to Herdr workspaces 1 through 9 |
| `Cmd+T` | Open a new Herdr tab immediately with a generated name |
| `Cmd+Shift+T` | Rename the focused Herdr tab |
| `Cmd+W` | Close the focused Herdr pane, not the tab |
| `Cmd+D` / `Cmd+Shift+D` | Split vertically / horizontally |
| `Cmd+Z` | Toggle zoom for the focused Herdr pane |
| `Cmd+Shift+H` / `Cmd+Shift+J` / `Cmd+Shift+K` / `Cmd+Shift+L` | Focus the pane left / down / up / right |
| `Cmd+P` | Open the Herdr Goto navigator |

The MX Master thumb wheel in Alacritty now sends `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` up/left
for previous Herdr tab and `Ctrl+Tab` down/right for next Herdr tab. The old
raw `Ctrl+Option+Tab` chords are gone.

Stock Alacritty/winit retains the native `Hide Alacritty` Cmd+H menu action;
Cmd+Shift+H is the Herdr pane-left shortcut. Cmd+K remains Alacritty's native
Clear History action.
