# AGENTS.md

Guidance for Codex and other AI agents working in this AeroSpace config.

## Scope

- Applies to `mac/.config/aerospace/` in the dotfiles repo.
- This directory configures AeroSpace, the macOS tiling window manager, via `aerospace.toml`.
- The config is managed through GNU Stow and is intended to appear at `~/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml`.
- Before behavioral edits, read `aerospace.toml`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Treat `aerospace.toml` as the source of truth when docs disagree. `CLAUDE.md` is the best human summary.

## Commands

```bash
aerospace reload-config          # Validate and apply config edits
aerospace list-windows --all     # Inspect app names, bundle IDs, workspaces
aerospace list-workspaces        # Inspect configured/active workspaces
aerospace list-apps              # Find bundle IDs for app matching rules
osascript -e 'id of app "AppName"'  # Alternative bundle ID lookup
```

Run `aerospace reload-config` after changing `aerospace.toml`. For documentation-only edits, no reload is needed.

## Files

- `aerospace.toml`: main config and source of truth.
- `CLAUDE.md`: concise overview of commands, keybindings, workspace assignments, and gotchas.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: dated behavior history; update it for meaningful config changes.
- `AGENTS.md`: agent-facing working notes.

## Current Config Model

- Launches the Homebrew-installed BSP fork at `/Applications/AeroSpace.app`
  through `start-at-login = true`.
- Uses flattened-container, opposite-orientation, and BSP-shape normalization.
  The BSP key is fork-only and must be removed before launching vanilla.
- Uses `config-version = 2`; keep `persistent-workspaces` aligned with the
  explicit workspace bindings when adding or removing one.
- Default layout is `tiles`; root orientation is `auto`.
- Accordion padding is `30`.
- All inner and outer gaps are `0`.
- Mouse moves to lazy center when focus changes monitors.
- macOS hidden apps are not automatically unhidden.

## Monitor Assignments

- Primary letter workspaces are forced to `LG HDR 4K`, falling back to macOS `main`.
- Workspace `1` plus workspaces `2`-`10`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `M`, `O`, `Y`, and `Z` are forced to the built-in display, falling back to `secondary` then `main`.
- AeroSpace `main` follows macOS System Settings -> Displays -> Use as Main Display; prefer explicit monitor names when preserving the LG-primary layout matters.

## App Assignment Rules

Rules are ordered. Specific rules must stay above broader rules, and the final catch-all rule must remain last.

| Workspace | Current automatic assignments |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | Persistent support workspace; terminals tile where they open |
| `2` | Calendar |
| `3` | Things, Linear |
| `4` | TradingView |
| `5` | IB Gateway |
| `6` | Trader Workstation |
| `8` | Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp |
| `10` | Spotify, YouTube Music |
| `A` | Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, sioyek |
| `B` | Arc, Firefox, Brave, Helium |
| `C` | ChatGPT, Chrome |
| `D` | Emacs |
| `E` | Finder floating |
| `F` | Drafts |
| `G` | Gemini, Grok |
| `M` | Gmail |
| `N` | Safari, Notion |
| `O` | Books floating, Obsidian |
| `S` | Slack |
| `V` | Claude |
| `X` | Amp, Conductor |
| `Y` | YouTube |
| `Z` | Day One |

Additional rules:

- `mpv`, `CodexBar`, `Codex`, CleanShot X, System Settings, and Raycast are floating only and are not moved to fixed workspaces.
- mpv floats where it opens and does not follow workspace changes. The
  Stow-managed `mac/.config/mpv/mpv.conf` enables `ontop=yes` above ordinary windows.
- ChatGPT stays assigned to workspace `C`. AeroSpace `0.21.0-Beta` and later
  classifies the always-on-top `com.openai.codex` Pet as an unmanaged popup,
  so no sticky-window rule or helper is required.
- The custom PiP guardian, workspace-change hook, and `ctrl-alt-p` recovery
  binding were removed on 2026-10-03 at the user's request. Do not restore them
  without an explicit request.
- CleanShot X, System Settings, and Raycast are floated in place so utility windows stay in the workspace where they were invoked.
- Cloudflare WARP, 1Password, `com.apple.LocalAuthentication.UIAgent`,
  `com.apple.coreservices.uiagent`, and `com.apple.ProblemReporter` are floating
  match-and-stop rules so popovers and transient system dialogs do not hit the
  catch-all.
- Unassigned tiled apps hit the final catch-all and move to the first empty
  workspace on the focused monitor. Floating windows, including dialogs
  AeroSpace recognizes, bypass it and stay where they appeared.

## PiP

No custom PiP following or recovery automation is installed. Historical details
are recorded in `docs/aerospace-pip-guardian.md` at the repository root.

## Keybindings

- `alt-hjkl`: focus left/down/up/right.
- `alt-shift-hjkl`: move window left/down/up/right.
- `alt-/`: toggle tiles horizontal/vertical.
- `alt-,`: toggle accordion horizontal/vertical.
- `alt--` / `alt-=`: resize smart -50/+50.
- `alt-1` through `alt-0`: switch to workspaces `1` through `10`.
- Letter workspace bindings exist for `A B C D E F G I M N O P Q S T U V W X Y Z`; `R` is commented out.
- Move-to-workspace bindings mostly mirror switch bindings, but `alt-shift-e` and `alt-shift-r` are commented out.
- `alt-tab` / `alt-shift-tab`: next / previous Herdr agent when Herdr is active.
- `alt-backtick`: switch to the next empty workspace on the focused monitor.
- `alt-shift-backtick`: move the focused window to the next empty workspace on the focused monitor.
- `cmd-shift-backtick`: move the focused window to the first empty workspace on the non-focused monitor.
- `alt-esc`: cycle windows in the current workspace.
- `ctrl-alt-n`: launch Safari private browsing via `~/.config/myFiles/macos/safari_incognito.scpt`.

Service mode starts with `alt-shift-;`:

- `esc`: reload config and return to main mode.
- `r`: flatten/reset the workspace layout.
- `f`: toggle floating/tiling.
- `backspace`: close all windows except current.
- `alt-shift-hjkl`: join with neighboring container.
- `up` / `down`: volume up/down.
- `shift-down`: mute and return to main mode.

## Editing Rules

- Prefer `if.app-id` for precise app rules when the bundle ID is known.
- Use `if.app-name-regex-substring` for flexible name matching, but beware broad matches.
- Keep `YouTube Music` above `YouTube`.
- If reintroducing a VS Code rule, prefer its bundle ID instead of matching `Code`, because broad name matching can catch unrelated apps.
- Keep Ghostty, Alacritty, cmux, and Warp tiled in the workspace where they
  open so the BSP layout can arrange separate terminal windows. Native tabs
  remain inside the terminal application and are not AeroSpace windows.
- Add menu-bar/popover exclusions above the catch-all using `run = ['layout floating']`.
- Keep the catch-all as the final `[[on-window-detected]]` block.
- For significant behavior changes, update `CHANGELOG.md` and keep `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` aligned with the real config.
- The config currently targets the BSP fork and intentionally contains the
  fork-only `enable-normalization-bsp-shape = true` key. Remove that key before
  switching to vanilla. Generic sticky windows remain unsupported, and the
  Codex Pet still does not need a sticky workaround.

## BSP Fork Lifecycle

- Active cask: `pszypowicz/tap/aerospace-bsp`.
- The fork tracks upstream releases as `<upstream>-bsp.<release>` but publishes
  on its own schedule. `brew upgrade --cask aerospace-bsp` installs only a BSP
  release published by the fork maintainer.
- The global config key is `enable-normalization-bsp-shape = true`. Unlike the
  `enable-normalization --workspace ... bsp-shape on` command, it survives app
  restarts and applies to every workspace.
- To return to vanilla, first remove the fork-only config key, then run:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask aerospace-bsp
brew install --cask nikitabobko/tap/aerospace
open -a AeroSpace
```

- To switch back to BSP, restore the fork-only config key, then run:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask aerospace
brew install --cask pszypowicz/tap/aerospace-bsp
open -a AeroSpace
```

## Known Doc Drift To Watch

- `CLAUDE.md` is closer to current state, but verify workspace tables against `aerospace.toml` before editing.
- The live config currently has no automatic VS Code assignment even though some docs mention workspace `P`.
- The live config floats `mpv` in place. It has no workspace-following helper
  or fixed workspace `E` assignment.
